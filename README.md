# Tradeshift Developer Training

Build a chat web application using the same technologies as Tradeshift
service and product teams.

The goal of the challenge is to familiarise new employees with the main
technologies used in the Tradeshift stack. After completing the training,
 you should be able to see the big picture.

## Timeframe

This is expected to take 3-4 weeks, but there is no set deadline.

## Authorship

All code must be written by the employee being trained, but you are free to ask
any other employee for advice.

## Iterations

### Requirements

- [First Iteration](FIRST_ITERATION.md)
- [Second Iteration](SECOND_ITERATION.md)

The work is split into several iterations. Each iteration seems to take about
a week, but that varies based on prior experience. The goal is to familiarize
yourself with Tradeshift technologies, so when you find an area of a technology
that interests you, follow that interest and learn.

### Git Flow

1. Requirements are posted in master of this repository
2. Fork this repository
3. Complete work in fork
4. Open Pull Request from fork to branch of original repository, based on GitHub account name:
  - e.g. trainee-account-name codechallenge-electra:master -> nealstewart codechallenge-electra:trainee-account-name

### Schedule

While there are no deadlines, we expect an iteration to take around a week.

Requirements for the next iteration will be posted once a week.

The day they are posted may vary depending an employee's start date.
