## First Iteration

Create a dockerized Jetty web service using Jersey that responds to the
following request from `curl`:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/messages/names/$name
```

and produces a response with header Content-Type: application/json and JSON payload:

```json
{"message": { "content": "Hello $name"}}
```

Furthermore, the service must meet the following requirements:

* Code must be written in java
* Maven is used to build the project and produce a war file
* Jetty is used as the web server
* The REST interface is produced by Jersey
* It must have a class `MessageResource` containing the REST API definition and a `MessageService` class, that performs the logic.
* It must use Spring for injecting the singleton `MessageService` bean into the `MessageResource` bean
* JAX RS / Jackson is used for serializing a `Message` DTO class into the REST response.
* The project must be built as a docker image using a Dockerfile starting with `FROM ubuntu:trusty`, and run as a docker container.
* The docker image must be built using maven using mvn package
* Jetty, including the web-application, should start when docker start is issued for the created docker image.
* You have to write every line of code yourself, but you can ask anyone for help. No-one is required to help though.
